## [2.2.0]

Added support for named colors. Lowered supported vscode version.

## [2.1.0]

Fixed bug: Color block stretching outside of document crashed extension. Changed color-blocks.add command shortcut to ctrl+K ctrl+B since ctrl+C will remove copy shortcut.

## [2.0.0]

Major changes:

- Added support for block comments.
- Added command for enabling/disabling color-blocks (visibility).
- Changed behavior of color block arguments.
  - Specifying number of lines as the second argument is now optional.
    - If number of lines is not specified, then the color block will continue until an empty line.
  - Color blocks now always color the entire comment in which the color block commands are written.
  - Number of lines now refer to the number of lines *after the comment line/block* to include in the color block. (Breaking)
- The `color-blocks.add` command can now be called using `ctrl+C ctrl+B`.
- Added setting to enlarge the comment text (it still looks a little wonky).

Minor changes / fixes:

- Skip expanding color-block at the very end of the document.
- Color-blocks with lines extending beyond the document line count are now truncated.
- Made updating existing color blocks with newlines more robust and reliable.
